/*
	The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
	a. @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
	b. @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and
	various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the
	application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
	c. @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example
	package, letting it find the controllers.
	d. The main() method uses Spring Bootâ€™s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. This web
	application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure via xml.
